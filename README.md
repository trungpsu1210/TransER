# TransER: Hybrid Model and Ensemble-based Sequential Learning for Non-homogenous Dehazing #

This code originally is proposed for TransER for single image dehazing. TransER consists of two separate deep neural networks which are TransConv Fusion Dehaze (TFD) model in Stage I and Lightweight Ensemble Reconstruction (LER) network in Stage II. The proposed method is inspired by vision transformer, dehazing fusion network, ensemble learning, and knowledge distillation
